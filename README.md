- [x] Breadth-first
- [x] Depth-first

- [x] 2 Finding shortest path (distance) from one location to another (Dijk-stra's Algorithm)

- [x] 3 Finding shortest path (time) from one location to another, assuming that each transfer takes one hour. 

- [ ] 4 Finding airline that has widest coverage (Minimum Spanning Tree)
